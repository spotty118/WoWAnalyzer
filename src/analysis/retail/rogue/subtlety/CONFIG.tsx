      <strong>Welcome, Subtlety Rogues!</strong> <br /> <br />
      This module is still a work in progress. It currently provides a solid analysis of the
      single-target rotation and highlights major mistakes. However, some aspects may still need
      improvement or further tuning.
      <br /> <br />
      The recommendations and analysis are based on{' '}
      <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/classes/rogue/subtlety/overview-pve-dps">WoWhead</a>
      <br /> <br />

        <AlertWarning>
          This analysis is a Work in Progress. I have made some initial updates for Rupture uptime,
          Shadow Dance usage, and Secret Technique tracking, but there is more to do. Apologies for
          the delays, I promise I am working on it. <code>@SamuelMaverick</code>
